# A-LOAM-KR

## A-LOAM STUDY with Korean Description
This repository is for studying A-LOAM in [SPARO LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/sparo) 22-23 winter SLAM study with Korean Description.
All codes are based on [A-LOAM](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/A-LOAM.git) with Ubuntu 20.04 version.


## Advanced implementation of LOAM

A-LOAM is an Advanced implementation of LOAM (J. Zhang and S. Singh. LOAM: Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time), which uses Eigen and Ceres Solver to simplify code structure. This code is modified from LOAM and [LOAM_NOTED](https://github.com/cuitaixiang/LOAM_NOTED). This code is clean and simple without complicated mathematical derivation and redundant operations. It is a good learning material for SLAM beginners.

## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**
Ubuntu 64-bit 20.04.
ROS Noetic. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)


### 1.2. **Ceres Solver**
Follow [Ceres Installation](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html).


## 2. Build A-LOAM
Clone the repository and catkin_make:

```
    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/A-LOAM.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
### Build TroubleShooting
<img src="https://github.com/hwan0806/A-LOAM-KR/blob/main/picture/boost_error.png" width = 720 height = 55%/>
if there are any boost error like above, you may add CMAKE option.

```
    catkin_make -DBoost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
```


## 3. Velodyne VLP-16 Example
Download [NSH indoor outdoor](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s05tBQOLNEDDurlg48KiUWxCp-YqYyGH/view) to YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER. 

```
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne aloam_velodyne_VLP_16.launch
    rosbag play YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/nsh_indoor_outdoor.bag
```


## 4. KITTI Example (Velodyne HDL-64)
Download [KITTI Odometry dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) to YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER and set the `dataset_folder` and `sequence_number` parameters in `kitti_helper.launch` file. Note you also convert KITTI dataset to bag file for easy use by setting proper parameters in `kitti_helper.launch`. 

```
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne aloam_velodyne_HDL_64.launch
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne kitti_helper.launch
```
